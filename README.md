### Repository: Test Webpages with Heading-Related Accessibility Problem

This repository contains a collection of test webpages designed to evaluate heading-related accessibility issues. Each webpage represents a specific scenario where headings in HTML documents exhibit varying accessibility challenges, such as missing accessible names, incorrect heading levels, or improper structure. 

The purpose of these test pages is to provide a basis for analyzing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting and resolving heading-related accessibility issues. Included in this repository are:

- **Original Webpage (0):** The baseline HTML document with no accessibility issues related to headings.
- **Modified Webpages (1-9):** Test webpages created by altering the original to introduce specific heading-related problems for evaluation purposes.
- **Screenshots (0-9):** Visual representations of each test webpage to support analysis.
